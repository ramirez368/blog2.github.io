# Steps and Explanation of the E-mail Process and Protocols.
We all use emails because it is fast and makes our lives easier.  In the conventional mailing system, the processing time was indefinite. When comparing both systems, there is a drastic difference. However, in some unusual situations, the emails could be delayed unpredictably.

Knowing how the email system works is important to all the email users. However, most of us are unaware of what goes on behind the scenes. Learning this will help to figure out the status of your emails sent that ended up in an error or with a bounce back message.

We will see the working of emails in detail in this article.

 

## What is email?

The term “email” stands for “electronic mail”. The electronic mail is introduced first in the 1960s, however it became available in the current structure in the 1970s. Let us take a look at how email actually works.

 

## Protocols used in email systems

The email communication is done via three protocols in general. They are listed below.

IMAP
POP
SMTP
 

## IMAP

The IMAP stands for Internet Mail Access Protocol. This protocol is used while receiving an email. When one uses IMAP, the emails will be present in the server and not get downloaded to the user’s mail box and deleted from the server. This helps to have less memory used in the local computer and server memory is increased.

## POP

The POP stands for Post Office Protocol. This protocol is also used for incoming emails. The main difference with the both protocols is that POP downloads the entire email into the local computer and deletes the data on the server once it is downloaded. This is helpful in a server with less free memory. Current version of POP is POP3.

## SMTP

The SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Email is sent using this protocol.

 

How does email work?

The diagram down below describes the path that email takes from your computer to the intended recipient . This shows the path of the email from sending to receiving ends. There are also many logical machines in the email delivery process. Please have a look at the diagram before proceeding
