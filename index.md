# Installation of the Apache Server

# Prerequisites
Before you begin this guide, you should have a regular, non-root user with sudo privileges configured on your server. Additionally, you will need to enable a basic firewall to block non-essential ports. You can learn how to configure a regular user account and set up a firewall for your server by following our Initial server setup guide for Ubuntu 20.04.

When you have an account available, log in as your non-root user to begin.

###Step 1 — Installing Apache
Apache is available within Ubuntu’s default software repositories, making it possible to install it using conventional package management tools.

Let’s begin by updating the local package index to reflect the latest upstream changes:

```
$ sudo apt update

```
```
 $ sudo apt install apache2
 ```
